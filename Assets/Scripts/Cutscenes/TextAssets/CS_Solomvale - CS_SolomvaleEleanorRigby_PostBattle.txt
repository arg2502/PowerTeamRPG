Extremist		Whew, that was worse than I expected...	
Cole		Enough clowning around!	
Jethro		Did you really go for a pun at a time like this?	
Extremist		My thoughts exactly. I mean,{0.2} puns--	
Eleanor		Can we get back to business, please?	
Jethro		Here's the deal, clown; you get serious and tell us what we need to know,{0.2} or we get back to beating you.	
Extremist		Whoa, slow down!	
Extremist		I'll tell you whatever you want to know.{0.2} Just ask before you start hitting again!	
Eleanor		What is going on in this town?	
Extremist		This small town of Solomvale is the first step of a grand movement.	
Extremist		The children of the North have been downtrodden for too long,{0.2} but now it is our time to rise up!	
Extremist		Our brotherhood has rounded up all citizens of Solomvale for elimination, driadali included.	
Cole		You've rounded them up? Where are they being held?	
Extremist		The prisoners have all been locked in the jailhouse, where our grand leader, Darklown, is preparing them for the cleansing.	
Cole		Darklown?	
Jethro		Great, more clowns.	
Eleanor		Where do we find the key to the jailhouse?	
Extremist		I don't know where it is. One of my brothers has it, and they're all occupying the other houses in town.	
Extremist		And if you thought I was bad, you won't stand a chance against them.{0.2} Any one of my brothers could squash you all!	
Jethro		Alright, that's enough out of you.	Pause
Jethro		What is with this clown?	
Cole		And you yelled at me for making puns...	
Jethro		I'm not making jokes.	
Jethro		Clown just happens to have a double meaning here.	
Cole		That is the <i>literal</i> definition of a pun!	
Eleanor		Can we focus, please?	
Cole		Alright, so what do we know?	
Cole		An extremist group has ransacked the town and kidnapped every denigen within it.	
Cole		We can only assume that your brother was taken, as well.	
Jethro		This guy called himself a Child of the North.{0.2} I thought you said that was an insult.	
Cole		For the majority of driadali, it <i>is</i> an insult.	
Cole		But some zealots wear that label proudly.{0.2} These people follow the political stylings of Knorvica and its twisted king.	
Jethro		Meaning what, exactly?	
Cole		The Kingdom of Knorvica is populated entirely by Draeds, and they still adhere to the laws of the Old Kings.	
Cole		By these laws, the Driadali are obligated, in order to ensure their survival, to wipe all other species from the continent, leaving the draeds alone to rule forever.	
Jethro		But then why would they take the driadali villagers, as well? Their own people?	
Cole		Probably the same reason this clown attacked me.{0.2} Just being with you two...{0.2} socializing with the "lesser beings".	
Eleanor		Nevermind the reasoning right now. It looks like everyone in town will be in a lot of trouble if we don't help them.	
Jethro		We?{0.2} I thought you didn't want to get your hands dirty.	
Eleanor		I've been thinking about what Cole said earlier, about inaction.{0.2} I see what you meant.	
Eleanor		If I don't help you two, there's no way you'll be able to save the citizens of Solomvale.	
Eleanor		If they die because I refuse to fight, their blood is on my hands.	
Eleanor		So let's get to work.	
Notification		Eleanor joins the team...{0.2}for real, this time
