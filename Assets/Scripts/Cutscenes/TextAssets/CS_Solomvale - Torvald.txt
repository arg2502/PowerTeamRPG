Cole		Hello sir, we are looking to build a team for a quest, and we were wondering--	
Torvald		Hold on,{0.2} let me guess.	
Torvald	HAPPY	You pipsqueaks need some real muscle for your team, and you were hoping to hire the famous Torvald the Strong!	
Jethro		No,{0.3} we already have muscle on the team.	
Torvald	HAPPY	You?{0.3} Surely you're joking.{0.3} Now,{0.1} let's discuss price...	
Cole		We're not joking.	
Torvald		Oh, well.{0.1}.{0.1}.{0.1} that's a bit awkward.	
Cole		We were actually hoping you'd know of a healer who's looking for work.	
Torvald		Normally, I'd charge for this kind of information, but I can tell you really need the help.	
Torvald		I've heard through the grapevine that Lady Eleanor, renowned healer of the Church of Morttimer, is looking for an escort to another town.	
Torvald		Perhaps you could work out a deal with her.	
Cole	HAPPY	Wonderful! Is she at the Church now?	
Torvald		I should think so. Today's services are about to begin.	
Cole		Thanks for the tip.{0.1} Come on, Jethro.	
Torvald		Good luck, pipsqueaks. You're gonna need it.	QuestTalk
