Father McKinsey	SAD	I am sorry, Eleanor, but I have not had a single denigen come to the church in response to your proposal.	
Eleanor		And you're certain no letters have come for me recently? {0.2}Have you talked to the Postmaster? Perhaps he's misplaced them...	
Father McKinsey		Do not despair, Lady Eleanor. {0.1}To despair is to doubt the hope that Morttimer instills in us all.	
Eleanor		Sorry, father. It's just...	
Eleanor	SAD	I'm worried about my brother.	
Father McKinsey		Remember that all hardships are part of Morttimer's greater plan.	
Father McKinsey		This is a time when He will be pushing you down a new path.	
Father McKinsey	HAPPY	Pray for the vision to see His signs.	Pause
Jethro		Are you Lady Eleanor?	
Eleanor		Indeed I am. And you are?	
Jethro		I'm Jethro, and this is Cole.	
Eleanor		I hesitate to ask, but to what do I owe the pleasure?	
Cole		We heard you are in need of an escort to another town.	
Eleanor	HAPPY	Oh, thank Morttimer, you're here to help me!{0.2} I was really beginning to worry that nobody would come.	
Eleanor		You see, since the Church brought me to Astrala Proper, I’ve had a bit of a long distance relationship with my little brother, <b>Rigby</b>, who stayed at home.	
Eleanor		We correspond by letter, but it’s been quite some time since I’ve heard from him. I fear something terrible has happened.	
Jethro		If you’re so worried, why didn’t you just go to him?	
Eleanor		I wanted to, believe me!	
Eleanor	SAD	But, my only skills are in divine healing through Morttimer. 	
Eleanor	SAD	I have no way of dealing with the wild monsters I may encounter on the road.	
Eleanor		That's why I need a protective escort.	
Cole		Where are you headed?	
Eleanor		Oh, I need to get to Solomvale.	
Cole	HAPPY	Solomvale?{0.3} That's just west of Astrala Proper.	
Cole	HAPPY	It's no trouble to walk there and back within a day..	
Cole		So why hasn't anyone else helped you yet?	
Cole	HAPPY	It sounds like easy money.	
Eleanor	SAD	That's just it...{0.3} I don't have any money to pay.	
Eleanor		I work for the Church, and they pay me graciously with food and shelter.	
Eleanor		It seems that the meager amount of gold I can offer doesn't pique the interest of hired swords.	
Jethro		So no one else will help you?	
Eleanor	SAD	That's the way it seems.	
Cole	HAPPY	Don't worry.{0.2} We may be able to help you free of charge...	
Cole	HAPPY	In exchange for your services.	
Eleanor	HAPPY	Really?{0.2} What do you need me to do?	
Cole	HAPPY	We are on a quest to remove the corrupt leader of the Mages' Guild from power.	
Cole	ANGRY	Archmage Villem Jeanne is sacrificing innocent denigens for his twisted rituals.	
Cole		I fear that if we don't stop him, no one will.	
Eleanor	ANGRY	Why that's horrible!	
Eleanor	SAD	But what could I do?{0.3} I'm not sure how you could reason with him.	
Jethro		We have our own method of reasoning that should work.	
Eleanor		This method.{0.1}.{0.1}.{0.1}does it involve.{0.1}.{0.1}.{0.1}	
Eleanor		...sock puppets?	
Cole	HAPPY	Not directly.	
Jethro		More like swords.	
Cole	HAPPY	More or less...	
Eleanor		Ah.{0.2} You would need me to aid you in combat?	
Cole	HAPPY	More or less...{0.2}but mostly more.	
Eleanor	SAD	Oh, I'm not sure...	
Cole	HAPPY	You won't have to actually fight, but we need a healer. And we've heard that you are quite skilled.	
Eleanor		As a healer of the Church, I have renounced aggression in exchange for Morttimer's healing Power.	
Eleanor		I generally do not aid in acts of violence...	
Eleanor		...but.{0.2}.{0.2}.{0.2}I will strongly consider it...	
Eleanor	SAD	...if I can see my brother in good health.	
Notification		<b>Eleanor</b> has joined the team.	Pause
Father McKinsey		Lady Eleanor,{0.2} you're departing? But services are about to begin. What has happened?	
Eleanor		I'm sorry, Father,{0.2} but these men have agreed to take me to Solomvale.	
Eleanor		I must see that Rigby is safe.	
Father McKinsey		Then you need not explain any more to me.{0.2} I understand.	
Father McKinsey		But, my children,{0.2} before you leave, let me impart to you some divine wisdom.	Pause
Father McKinsey		The Grace of Morttimer can be found by praying to any statues such as these.	
Father McKinsey		His Grace will heal your weary spirits,{0.2} and He will record any deeds you have done since your last prayer.	
Father McKinsey		And if you should ever fall in combat, you may find yourself whole at the statue where you last prayed.	
Father McKinsey	HAPPY	Now go,{0.2} and may Morttimer's eyes always be upon you.
