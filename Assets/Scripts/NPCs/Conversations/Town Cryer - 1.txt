		What news would you like to hear?	The King's Visit[7]_A Mysterious Buyer[6]
		The King of Knorvica is set to visit Astrala Proper for a historic meeting with the Astralan chancellors.	
		High Chancellor Jericho is hopeful that these talks will lead to the Knorvican Kingdom finally uniting with the Confederation of Astrala.	
		But many think his optimism is unfounded.	
		Perhaps centuries of tensions between border disputes, opposing ideals, and hostilities from both sides can be resolved in one closed door meeting.	
		Then again, maybe not.	
		Coming up: Is it possible to carry a Morttimer's Statue around with you to use at any time?

		Traders throughout Astrala Proper were baffled today when a denigen attempted to pay for her goods.{0.25}.{0.25}.{0.25}with fragments of paper.	
		"This is the currency of the future!" she declared to a blacksmith who was really regretting asking about the paper and just wanted to get on with her day.	
		"They may not be worth anything now, but one day the whole realm will be using 'teckits'!" she declared again, this time to a bank Shenanigan too polite to not engage in conversation.	
		Shortly after this statement, eye witnesses report seeing a male driadali dressed all in white appear from thin air, shout "Not this shit again, Denisse." and drag the denigen by the scruff out of the bank before vanishing.	
		Bank officials have announced they will be donating any leftover 'teckits' to the Artisan's Guild for their "fun crafts or whatever it is they do. We don't really care."	
		This report has been brought to you by the Mage's Guild.{0.25}.{0.25}Magic:{0.5} Where else are you gonna go?
