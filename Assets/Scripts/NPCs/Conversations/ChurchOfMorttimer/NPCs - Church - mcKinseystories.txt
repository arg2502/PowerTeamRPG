		Father McKinsey is a legend amongst the Mortterian Clergy. He is one of the youngest denigens ever to ascend to the title of Father. He has many miraculous deeds on record.	
		I've witnessed a few of them myself. I can tell you about them, if you're interested...	Mass Exorcism[11]_Nevermind[1]
	HAPPY	Oh! The story of Father McKinsey's first mass exorcism?! That's a <b>good one</b>. Where to begin....	
		One day, a number of years ago, everyone in Astrala Proper awoke to find that their Socks had been possessed by moderately malign spirits.	
	SAD	The spirits turned all woolen socks to cotton, and all cotton socks to wool...	
	SAD	This was quite upsetting to sock wearing folk, as I'm <b>sure</b> you can imagine.	
		Father McKinsey,{0.5} then referred to as <b>Brother</b> McKinsey{0.5}, ordered all socks be thrown into a pile in the middle of the Market Square.	
		Once all of the socks in town had been amassed in the center of market, Father McKinsey got to work...	
	ANGRY	Repeatedly, he screamed, 'DARN YOU, DARN YOU ALL!!!'	
		He did this whilst doing the Chasse all the way around the mountain of socks.	
		All at once, the socks were struck by the Power of <b>Morttimer</b> and they <b>burst</b> into flames!	
	SAD	When the holy fire died down, we knew that our socks were no longer possessed{0.5}.{0.5}.{0.5}.{0.5} because the socks had been completely reduced to ash.	
	HAPPY	It was a <b>wonderful day</b>!	
	SAD	Oh, well... If you ever wish to hear stories of Father McKinsey, you know where to find me.
